Vesuvius Challenge Sample Data
=============================

This directory contains sample data for testing the Fisherman's Net algorithm.

Directory Structure:
- ink_detection_example: Sample data for ink detection
- scroll_packing_example: Example of scroll packing
- fragment_samples: Fragment sample data
- synthetic_data: Synthetically generated scroll data

For testing the Fisherman's Net algorithm, the synthetic_data directory contains:
- synthetic_scroll.npy: A synthetic volume mimicking real scroll data
- synthetic_fibers.npy: Synthetic fiber predictions
- synthetic_orientations.npy: Synthetic fiber orientation vectors

These files are in the correct format to be used directly with the Fisherman's Net algorithm.
