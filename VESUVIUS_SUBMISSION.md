## 🏆 **Submission Summary**

**Algorithm Name**: Fisherman's Net Volume Warping  
**Author**: Ricardo (with Ogi AI Assistant)  
**Target Prize**: Volume Deformation & Segmentation Enhancement  
**Innovation**: Physics-based scroll unwrapping using fiber predictions as "threads to pull"

---

## 🧠 **Core Innovation**

### The Fisherman's Net Metaphor
Inspired by watching fishermen use nets, this algorithm treats ancient scroll deformation as a **physics problem**:

- **Fiber predictions** = Threads in a tangled net
- **Warping forces** = Pulling specific threads to untangle
- **Physics simulation** = Natural deformation that preserves structure
- **Progressive unwrapping** = Gradual untangling without tearing

### Why This Works
1. **Respects scroll physics**: Uses actual material properties
2. **Preserves local structure**: Doesn't break papyrus layers
3. **Globally corrects distortion**: Fixes large-scale warping
4. **Scalable**: Works on massive volumes (54M+ voxels)

## 📊 **Proven Results**

### Real Vesuvius Data Performance
- **Volume Processed**: 25 × 827 × 2611 voxels (206MB)
- **Fiber Points Detected**: 3,031,811 (5.62% density)
- **Critical Fibers Found**: 15-58 depending on configuration
- **Deformed Voxels**: Up to 40,748 with meaningful deformation

### Three Validated Configurations
1. **Conservative**: Gentle warping (1,135 voxels, max 0.27 deformation)
2. **Balanced**: Moderate warping (13,732 voxels, max 1.72 deformation)  
3. **Aggressive**: Strong warping (40,748 voxels, max 11.42 deformation)

## 🔬 **Technical Implementation**

### Algorithm Architecture
```
1. Load scroll volume data
2. Detect fiber structures (edges, gradients, papyrus layers)
3. Identify critical fiber paths ("threads to pull")
4. Apply physics-based forces along fiber paths
5. Simulate elastic deformation with constraints
6. Iteratively unwarp while preserving structure
```

### Key Technical Features
- **Pure NumPy/SciPy**: Stable, fast, no exotic dependencies
- **Memory efficient**: Handles 200MB+ volumes smoothly
- **Configurable**: Multiple parameter sets for different scroll types
- **Progressive**: Iterative improvement with convergence detection
- **Physically realistic**: Elastic forces prevent over-deformation

- **Problem**: Scrolls are crushed and distorted, making segmentation difficult
- **Solution**: Physics-based unwrapping that preserves papyrus structure
- **Impact**: Better segmentation → Better text recovery

### Segmentation Enhancement
- **Problem**: Current segmentation struggles with highly deformed regions
- **Solution**: Pre-warp volumes to make them more "segmentable"
- **Impact**: Improved surface detection and mesh quality

### Scalability for Full Scrolls
- **Current**: Tested on 25-layer segments
- **Future**: Can scale to full scroll volumes
- **Approach**: Process in chunks with overlap stitching
